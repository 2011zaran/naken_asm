RPT Instruction
---------------

It was difficult to find good documentation on how the RPT instruction
is supposed to work so naken_asm uses the following syntax:

    rpt #5, rrum.a #2, r9
    rptz #5, rrum.a #2, r9
    rptc #5, rrum.a #2, r9
    rpt r4, rrum.a #2, r9
    rptz r4, rrum.a #2, r9
    rptc r4, rrum.a #2, r9
