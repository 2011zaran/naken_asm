### Syntax
**naken\_asm** uses syntax that is in keeping with modern programming styles. Some traditional syntax is also available. Please refer to the main documentation for a full description of the modern syntax.

| Traditional    | Modern                     | Description                  |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| lda #44        | lda #44                    | decimal representation       |
| lda #$44       | lda #0x44                  | hexadecimal representation   |
| lda %10101010  | lda 10101010b              | binary representation\*      |
| lda #<$444444  | lda #444444 & 0xFF         | grab first byte              |
| lda #>$444444  | lda #(444444 >> 8) & 0xFF  | grab second byte             |
| lda #^$444444  | lda #(444444 >> 16) & 0xFF | grab third byte              |
| lda <$4444     | lda.b 0x4444               | force direct mode            |
| lda !$44       | lda.w 0x44                 | force absolute mode          |
| lda >$4444     | lda.l 0x4444               | force absolute long mode     |

\**Traditional syntaxes for binary and octal are not currently supported.*

In immediate mode, **.b** forces a byte quanity, **.w** forces a word, and **.l** forces a long. Otherwise if the value is an address, then **.b** forces direct mode, **.w** forces absolute mode, and **.l** force absolute long mode.

Though it has 24-bit addressing modes, the program counter on the 65816 is 16-bit only, therefore the program must reside between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF, and bank selected with the Program Bank Register. *Note: There is no "re-org" command, so modules using different banks should be placed in separate files to avoid problems.*
